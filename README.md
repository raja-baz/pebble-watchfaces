Pebble Watchfaces
=================

[Pebble](http://getpebble.com/) is an e-paper watch that has
programmable watchfaces. This repo contains my experiements or
modifications to existing watchfaces.

## Simplicity 2

A variation on the simplicity watchface that has an AM/PM display in
12-hr mode. Also, removed the delay when first switching watch and
before the time is actually displayed.

## Fuzzy Time Arabic

Exactly what the name says, except that the form of arabic it uses is
actually the Lebanese way of telling time and it uses transliteration
instead of an actual arabic font.
